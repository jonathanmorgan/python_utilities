## Installation

### Option 1: pip for stable version

Use pip:

    (sudo) pip install python-utilities-jsm

### Option 2: latest from github

Clone this repository ( [https://github.com/jonathanmorgan/python_utilities.git](https://github.com/jonathanmorgan/python_utilities.git) ) and place it somewhere in your PYTHON\_PATH, including the base "python\_utilities" directory.  The easiest way to use these libraries with a Django site is to clone this repository into the site's project folder (where `manage.py` lives) alongside other applications, so these utilities are a part of the same python path as other django apps.  These utilities are used by other of my django applications, as well.  They can also be used outside of django.

Dependencies are listed below.  You can install them individually, or you can just use the `requirements*.txt` files, which lists them all out, to install them all at once using pip.  The command to install base packages, without database-specific support:

    (sudo) pip install -r python_utilities/requirements.txt


### For either option, database packages

For database packages, you'll need to load the requirements file for each database you want to interact with (right now `requirements_pgsql.txt` for postgresql and `requirements_mysql.txt` for MySQL).  Whichever you install, you'll also need to make sure you installed the client and client-dev libraries for each database you use.

### /beautiful\_soup/*

Requires the Beautiful Soup 4 package, installed via pip:

    (sudo) pip install BeautifulSoup4

If you are planning on using Beautiful Soup's "UnicodeDammit" class, you also should install chardet and/or cchardet:

    (sudo) pip install chardet
    (sudo) pip install cchardet

### /strings/html_helper.py

requires bleach, a library for selectively parsing HTML and XML:

    (sudo) pip install bleach

and requires the Beautiful Soup 4 package, installed via pip:

    (sudo) pip install BeautifulSoup4

### /database/MySQLdb\_helper.py

Before you can connect to MySQL with this code, you need to do the following:

- install the MySQL client if it isn't already installed.  On linux, you'll also need to install a few dev packages (python-dev, libmysqlclient-dev) ( [source](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/how-to-set-up-mysql-for-python-on-ubuntu/) ).

- install the MySQLdb python package.  To install, you can either install through your operating system's package manager (ubuntu, for example, has package "python-mysqldb") or using pip (`sudo pip install MySQL-python`).

### /database/psycopg2\_helper.py

Before you can connect to Postgresql with this code, you need to do the following (based on [http://initd.org/psycopg/install/](http://initd.org/psycopg/install/)):

- install the PostgreSQL client if it isn't already installed.  On linux, you'll also need to install a few dev packages (python-dev, libpq-dev) ( [source](http://initd.org/psycopg/install/) ).

- install the psycopg2 python package.  Install using pip (`sudo pip install psycopg2`).

### /database/PyMySQL\_helper.py

Before you can connect to MySQL with this code, you need to do the following:

- install the PyMySQL python package.  To install, use pip (`sudo pip install PyMySQL`) or conda if you are using anaconda (`conda install pymysql`).

### /network/*

Requires you install mechanize, a library that implements a browser client in python, and requests:

    (sudo) pip install mechanize
    (sudo) pip install requests

### /strings/*

Requires you to install the "six" package, which helps make python code that can run in either python 2 or 3:

    (sudo) pip install six

## Usage

### /exceptions/exception\_helper.py

For a class you want to use ExceptionHelper for outputting and potentially emailing exception messages:

    # import ExceptionHandler
    from python_utilities.exceptions.exception_helper import ExceptionHelper

    # import logging
    import logging

    # make instance
    my_exception_helper = ExceptionHelper()

    # by default, logs to logger with name "python_utilities.exceptions.exception_helper".
    # if you want it to log to a different logger name, initialize that logger,
    #    then pass it to the set_logger() method.  Example:
    #
    # my_logger = logging.getLogger( "logger_name_example" )
    # my_exception_helper.set_logger( my_logger )

    # By default, ExceptionHelper logs exception information to logging.ERROR.
    #    You can set the level at which your exception helper will log messages:
    # my_exception_helper.set_logging_level( logging.DEBUG )

    # configure mail settings?
    '''
    smtp_host = 'localhost'
    smtp_port = 1234
    smtp_use_ssl = True
    smtp_username = "smtp_user"
    smtp_password = "smtp_pass"
    my_exception_helper.email_initialize( smtp_host, smtp_port, smtp_use_ssl, smtp_username, smtp_password ):
    '''

    # log an exception
    try:

        pass

    catch Exception as e:

        # log exception.
        exception_message = "Exception caught for article " + str( current_article.id )

        # no email
        my_exception_helper.process_exception( e, exception_message )

        # with email
        # my_exception_helper.process_exception( e, exception_message, True, "email_subject" )

    #-- END try-catch --#

If you are going to be in a long-running or looping process, consider initializing at the beginning and storing instance in a variable, so you can reuse it.

Also, this class extends LoggingHelper, so it can take advantage of that set of functionality as well, outlined below.

### /logging/logging_helper.py

The `LoggingHelper` class can be used two ways:

1. you can create an instance of it and use that to retrieve a python logger.

        # import logging and LoggingHelper
        import logging
        from python_utilities.logging.logging_helper import LoggingHelper

        # make a Logger instance.
        my_logger_factory = LoggingHelper()

        # set the logger name
        my_logger_factory.set_logger_name( "test_logger" )

        # get a python logging.logger
        my_logger = my_logger_factory.get_logger()


2. You can use it as a parent class for an existing class to add a variable for a logger and a logging application name and methods to get and set each to a class.

        # import logging and Logger
        import logging
        from python_utilities.logging.logging_helper import LoggingHelper

        # make Logger the parent class
        class MyClass( LoggingHelper ):

            # in your __init__() method, call parent __init__(), then set
            #    self.logger_name to either __name__ or a name you prefer.
            def __init__( self ):

                # call parent's __init__()
                super( MyClass, self ).__init__()

                # set self.logger_name
                self.set_logger_name( "MyClass" )

            #-- END __init__() method --#

            # then, to get logger instance, call self.get_logger().

        #-- END class MyClass --#


### /logging/summary\_helper.py

How to use the summary helper:

    # import SummaryHelper
    from python_utilities.logging.summary_helper import SummaryHelper

    # initialize summary helper - this sets start time, as well.
    my_summary_helper = SummaryHelper()

    # auditing variables
    article_counter = -1
    exception_counter = -1

    # update the variables

    # once you are done:

    # set stop time
    my_summary_helper.set_stop_time()

    # add stuff to summary
    my_summary_helper.set_prop_value( "article_counter", article_counter )
    my_summary_helper.set_prop_desc( "article_counter", "Articles processed" )

    my_summary_helper.set_prop_value( "exception_counter", exception_counter )
    my_summary_helper.set_prop_desc( "exception_counter", "Exception count" )

    # output - set prefix if you want.
    summary_string += my_summary_helper.create_summary_string( item_prefix_IN = "==> " )
    print( summary_string )

Example output:

    ==> Articles processed: 46
    ==> Exception count: 20
    ==> Start time: 2014-12-31 14:32:28.221066
    ==> End time: 2014-12-31 14:32:41.982753
    ==> Duration: 0:00:13.761687

### /network/http_helper.py

The `Http_Helper` class lets you configure an HTTP request in an instance of `Http_Helper` using its built in storage for request properties and headers, then submit the request using either the urllib2 ([https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html)), mechanize ([http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/)), or requests ([http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)) packages.  For a given request and package, you can either get the page itself, or just submit a URL to find its final redirected URL.

Example: using requests package to submit a post request.

    # create Http_Helper
    my_http_helper = Http_Helper()

    # set http headers
    my_http_helper.set_http_header( "Content-Type", "text/plain" )

    # request type
    my_http_helper.request_type = Http_Helper.REQUEST_TYPE_POST

    # place body of request in a variable.
    request_data = "My dog has fleas, figaro, figaro, figaro!"

    # make the request using requests package:
    requests_response = my_http_helper.load_url_requests( "http://yahoo.com", request_type_IN = Http_Helper.REQUEST_TYPE_POST, data_IN = request_data )

    # get raw text response:
    requests_raw_text = requests_response.text

    # convert to a json object:
    requests_response_json = requests_response.json()

    # to make request using mechanize (a full-featured web browser):
    mechanize_response = my_http_helper.load_url_mechanize( "http://yahoo.com", request_type_IN = Http_Helper.REQUEST_TYPE_POST, data_IN = request_data )

    # to make request using urllib2:
    urllib2_response = my_http_helper.load_url_urllib2( "http://yahoo.com", request_type_IN = Http_Helper.REQUEST_TYPE_POST, data_IN = request_data )

Troubleshooting:

- If you are using the requests package and have data that you want to pass to the `load_url_requests()` method in variable `data_IN` that is a unicode string, if that unicode string has any non-ascii characters, you must encode the data before passing it in, else somewhere down in a library, something detects that the data is a unicode string and tries to encode it to "ASCII", which fails if there any non-ascii characters.  If you encode to UTF-8 before passing the data in, this converts to a byte string, and all works fine.

    - An example of the stack trace and exception message you'll see if you have this problem:

### /parameters/param\_container.py

Usage:

    # import ParamContainer
    from python_utilities.parameters.param_container import ParamContainer

    # make an instance
    my_param_container = ParamContainer()

    # define parameters (for outputting debug, nothing more at this point)
    my_param_container.define_parameter( "test_int", ParamContainer.PARAM_TYPE_INT )
    my_param_container.define_parameter( "test_string", ParamContainer.PARAM_TYPE_STRING )
    my_param_container.define_parameter( "test_list", ParamContainer.PARAM_TYPE_LIST )

    # load parameters in a dict
    my_param_container.set_parameters( params )

    # load parameters from a django HTTP request
    my_param_container.set_request( request )

    # get parameter value - pass name and optional default if not present.
    test_int = my_param_container.get_param( "test_int", -1 )
    test_string = my_param_container.get_param( "test_string", "" )
    test_list = my_param_container.get_param( "test_list", [] )

    # get param as int
    test_int = my_param_container.get_param_as_int( "test_int", -1 )

    # get param as str
    test_string = my_param_container.get_param_as_str( "test_string", -1 )

    # get param as list - pass in name, optional default, list delimiter string (defaults to ",")
    test_int = my_param_container.get_param_as_list( "test_int", -1, delimiter_IN = "," )

### /rate\_limited/basic\_rate\_limited.py

For a class you want to be rate-limited:

- have that class import and extend `BasicRateLimited`.

        # import
        from python_utilities.rate_limited.basic_rate_limited import BasicRateLimited

        # class definition
        def class SampleClass( BasicRateLimited ):

- in that class's `__init__()` method, call the parent `__init__()` method, then set instance variable `rate_limit_in_seconds` to the minimum number of seconds you want between requests (can be a decimal).

        def __init__( self ):

            # call parent's __init__()
            super( SampleClass, self ).__init__()

            # declare variables

            # limit to no more than 4 per second
            self.rate_limit_in_seconds = 0.25

        #-- END method __init__() --#

- At the start of each transaction, call the `self.start_request()` method to let the code know you're starting a request.
- Once the request is done, call `continue_collecting = self.may_i_continue()` this method will block if you have to wait, will return true if it is OK to continue, will return False if some error occurred.
- In your control structure, always check the result of `may_i_continue()` before continuing.
